# system-graph

'system-graph' is a Clojure library for using Prismatic's [Graph] in large system composition.

'Graph' provides a form of dependency injection which does all of the hard work. 'system-graph'
builds on top of this to allow Graphs to be compiled so that `SystemGraph`s are returned. These
`SystemGraph`s implement a `Lifecycle` protocol that enables the components of the system to be
started and shut down in a coordinated fashion. The beauty of using 'Graph' is that [the correct
order] of the components is implicitly defined by the Graph's [Fnks].

## Introduction

While dependency injection and containers that manage `Lifecycle` is [nothing][DI] [new][pico] this
approach has been gaining traction in the Clojure community recently.  Rather than adding [yet][jig]
[another][teuta] `Lifecycle` protocol to the Clojure ecosystem 'system-graph' uses Stuart Siearra's
[Component] library. Please *[read the documentation for Component][Component docs]* for an overview of this
approach as well as some great advice on applying it within a Clojure application.
